## Competition: Understanding Canadian vehicle emissions and an inventory analysis for a bicycle retailer

The project is a submission for a competition on Datacamp. Please do not copy any part of the document be it thecoding or the markdown cells.

Both problems were tackled using Python and SQL, respectively.

The SQL cells do not show any output as I do not have access to the database outside the Datacamp environment.
